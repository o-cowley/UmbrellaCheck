# UmbrellaCheck
This is a simple program that uses a weather api and your location to tell you if you should bring an umbrella.
The slider allows you to chose how much risk you are willing to take. Risk in this case is at what "possibility
of precipitation" you want the program to tell you it is umbrealla time! For example, the highest risk will only
tell you to bring an umbrella if there is a 100% chance of severe precipitation, that is anything that is heavy rain
or more intense.
